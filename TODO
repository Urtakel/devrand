* auto-detect presence of the Pentium TSC.

* multiple irqs

* README/LICENCE/package/post

The following would make the implementation more complete, but
aren't necessary.

* keep the device times up to date

* chmod(), chown() - in case you want to change this on-the-fly

* ioctl() - random.c allows a few ioctls, I could do for complete
  Linux emulation.

* write() - Used by Linux to seed the randomness, I don't intend
  to implement this, I'm not convinced of its usefulness.
