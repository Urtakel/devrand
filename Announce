*** Port of gnupg-1.0.1 and Linux's /dev/random device to QNX4 & Neutrino

I've ported gnupg-1.0.1 to QNX4 (not hard) but it complains
about not having a good source of randomness. The web page
recommends against encrypting messages or generating keys
with gpg without a source of randomness, and cites Linux's
as a good one, so I ported it. I also ported it to Neutrino.

Neutrino lacks so many of the utilities used by the generic
unix code to attempt entropy gathering in user-space that
gnupg runs so slowly as to be unuseable without a /dev/random.

For gnupg, the patches, a tar of the patched files for those
lacking GNU patch, and binaries for those lacking GNU cc are
on my web site, as well as the source for the driver for
/dev/random.

If anybody has problems with the driver, or the gnupg port,
drop me a line.
