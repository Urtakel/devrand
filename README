QNX4 Port of Linux's /dev/random

** Introduction

This is a port of the random device from Linux, Version 1.04 of
random.c, to QNX4 and Nto2.

The device has a simple API intended to be called from the rest of the
kernel on the occurence of random events (such as irqs), and
internally consists mostly or arithmetic operations. Compiling it
was mostly a matter of providing the typedefs used in Linux, and
ifdefing out unused code (such as read/write/poll and tcp-specific
support).

This device is apparently well-trusted as a source of randomness,
and since none of the internal code has been modified by me, I hope
these drivers may inherit some of that trust.

** Installation

# make install

** Running

   - QNX -
# Dev.random -h

   - Nto -
# devc-random -h

** Credits

random.c was written by Theodore Ts'o, see the file for his
acknowledgements, and detailed descriptions of how this works.
It is GPLed.

rdtsc64.h was scrounged from various uncredited technotes on
QUICS (www.qnx.com). I assume it's public domain.

The resource manager frameworks were tacked on by me. It's GPLed.

If anybody finds any problems with it, please contact me.

Thanks to those who wrote the hard stuff!
